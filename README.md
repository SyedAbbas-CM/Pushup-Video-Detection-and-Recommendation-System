# Pushup-Video-Detection-and-Recommendation-System
An AI-powered push-up form detection and correction system using deep learning techniques, such as CNN-LSTM, to analyze and provide real-time feedback on push-up exercises for improved fitness and injury prevention



Gather data:
Collect a dataset of videos or images showing people performing push-ups in various positions and with different form quality. This dataset should be diverse in terms of body shapes, sizes, and camera angles. You might want to label the data with information such as whether the form is correct or incorrect, and what specific issues are present if the form is incorrect.

Preprocess the data:
Preprocess your data by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset with techniques like rotations, flips, and translations. Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Choose a model architecture:
Select a suitable deep learning model architecture for your task. For detecting push-ups and analyzing form, you might consider using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or a transformer-based architecture. You can also explore pre-trained models like OpenPose or PoseNet for pose estimation.

Implement the model:
Using PyTorch, implement your chosen model architecture. If you're using a pre-trained model, fine-tune it on your dataset. Define the loss function and optimizer for training your model.


Train the model:
Train your model using the training dataset, and evaluate its performance on the validation dataset. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs as needed to optimize performance. Use the test set to evaluate the final performance of your model.

Interpret results and provide feedback:
Once your model can accurately detect push-ups and assess form, create a function that interprets the results and provides feedback to users. This might involve converting class probabilities into human-readable feedback, such as "Keep your back straight" or "Lower your body more."

Deploy the model:
Package your model and the associated code into a web or mobile application so that users can access it. You might consider using tools like Flask or FastAPI for creating a web-based API, or tools like PyTorch Mobile or TensorFlow Lite for deploying to mobile devices.
