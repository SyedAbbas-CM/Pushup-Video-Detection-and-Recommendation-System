## Steps

### Gather data: Completed
Collect a dataset of videos or images showing people performing push-ups in various positions and with different form quality. This dataset should be diverse in terms of body shapes, sizes, and camera angles. You might want to label the data with information such as whether the form is correct or incorrect, and what specific issues are present if the form is incorrect.

### Preprocess the data: Completed
Preprocess your data by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset with techniques like rotations, flips, and translations. Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

### Choose a model architecture:
Select a suitable deep learning model architecture for your task. For detecting push-ups and analyzing form, you might consider using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or a transformer-based architecture. You can also explore pre-trained models like OpenPose or PoseNet for pose estimation.

### Implement the model:
Using PyTorch, implement your chosen model architecture. If you're using a pre-trained model, fine-tune it on your dataset. Define the loss function and optimizer for training your model.


### Train the model:
Train your model using the training dataset, and evaluate its performance on the validation dataset. Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs as needed to optimize performance. Use the test set to evaluate the final performance of your model.

### Interpret results and provide feedback:
Once your model can accurately detect push-ups and assess form, create a function that interprets the results and provides feedback to users. This might involve converting class probabilities into human-readable feedback, such as "Keep your back straight" or "Lower your body more."

### Deploy the model:
Package your model and the associated code into a web or mobile application so that users can access it. You might consider using tools like Flask or FastAPI for creating a web-based API, or tools like PyTorch Mobile or TensorFlow Lite for deploying to mobile devices.



## Different Model Approaches


### CNN-LSTM (our current approach):
A combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be used for this task. The CNN is responsible for extracting spatial features from the images, while the LSTM captures the temporal relationships between frames. This approach is particularly suitable for video-based action recognition tasks.

### 3D CNN:
3D CNNs are similar to regular CNNs but operate on 3D input data (e.g., video clips). Instead of 2D convolutions, 3D CNNs use 3D convolutions, which allows them to capture both spatial and temporal information. This makes 3D CNNs suitable for video classification tasks. However, they can be computationally expensive compared to 2D CNNs.

### Two-Stream CNN:
Two-Stream CNNs use two separate CNN branches to process the input data: a spatial stream and a temporal stream. The spatial stream processes individual video frames to extract spatial features, while the temporal stream processes optical flow data (capturing motion between consecutive frames) to extract temporal features. The outputs of both streams are combined before being fed into a fully connected layer for classification. This approach can provide improved performance in video-based action recognition tasks compared to using a single CNN.

### Transformer-based models:
Transformer-based architectures, such as BERT, GPT, and ViT, have shown excellent performance in various tasks, including image and video understanding. These models rely on self-attention mechanisms instead of convolutions or recurrent connections to capture long-range dependencies in the input data. Transformers can be applied to video-based action recognition by processing sequences of image patches or by combining spatial and temporal embeddings. The downside of using Transformer-based models is that they can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data for training.

### Pre-trained models:
Using pre-trained models, like OpenPose or PoseNet for pose estimation, can provide an excellent starting point for your task. These models are trained on large-scale datasets and can detect key body points in images or videos. By incorporating these keypoints into your model, you can focus on the relationships between body points to detect push-ups and analyze form. You can use these pre-trained models as feature extractors and fine-tune them on your push-up dataset.
